It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents--except 
at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust 
of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our 
scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating 
the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.
