# Programming Problems

## 1. Using print and f-strings

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E1.py`. 
2. Add a header comment (each line starts with a #) at the top of the file with your name and one line saying what this is.
3. Consider this poem

	```None

	Algorithm first
	Data and code and struggle 
	Program emerges
	```

4. Write Python code to print the poem exactly as it is appears above. Include the blank line that precedes the code.
5. Write more Python code to print it with a single `print()` statement.
5. Assuming that the page is 40 characters wide write Python code to print the poem left aligned. (Use f-strings)
6. Assuming that the page is 40 characters wide write Python code to print the poem centered.

## 2. Using input and variables

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E2.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Create three string variables, `line1`, `line2`, `line3` and assign the lines from the poem to them.
3. Print the poem centered in the 40 character field, as in 6. above but using the variables you just created. 
4. Rewrite the code that creates the three variables so that each one is input by the user.
5. Run the program so that it prints your three line poem.

## 3. Input, output and arithmetic expressions 1

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E3.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Write a program that prompts the user for a number of seconds. Remember that `input()` returns a string so the return value from your input statement will need to be ***cast*** to an ``int``. Print the number of seconds.
3. Edit the program to calucate the number of minutes contained in the seconds given. This should be an integer value. (Remember the operators that are available to you: +, -, *, /, //, %, **). Print both the number of minutes and the original number of seconds.
4. Run your program multiple times to test it. Use values that you know what the result should be. For example:
   1. 0 should calculate 0 minutes.
   2. 60 should calculate 1 minute.
   3. 240 should calculate 4 minutes.
   4. 200 should calculate 3 minutes.
5. How many seconds are remaining after you take out the whole number of minutes? For example, if 100 is entered, that is 1 minute (60 seconds) with 40 seconds left over. Add code to calculate and print that value. Your output should now be three values, the original number of seconds, the minutes and the remaining seconds. Test your code.
6. Did you use a magic number in your code? You needed to divide by 60 or the number of seconds per minute. That is a good use case for a named constant. Remember that constants are all upper case and appear at the top of the program file, after the initial header comment. Add a constant to your code. 
7. Format the output so that it appears like this: ``140 seconds is 02:20`` or  ``65 seconds is 01:05``. Note the leading zeros. You will need to use f-strings to format this correctly. 

## 4. Input, output and arithmetic expressions 2

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E4.py`. and add the required header comment block. 
2. Building on what you wrote in 3. above write a program that inputs a number of seconds and displays the days, hours, minutes and seconds like this:
``172000 seconds is 1 days 23:46:40``
3. Test your program thoroughly.

## 5. Input, output and arithmetic expressions 3

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E5.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Write a program that prompts for a purchase price, calculates the 5% GST and prints a receipt like this:
```None
   Item Cost $854,269.23
         GST  $42,713.46

       Total $896,982.69 
```
3. Test your program. 

## 6. Input, output and arithmetic expressions 4

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E6.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Write a program that prompts for an initial investment value, the annual interest rate and the number of years to hold the investment. (When something like an interest rate or growth rate is expressed as a rate, assume a decimal number 0-1.0. If it asked for the percentage then give the rate times 100. i.e. 0.05 is the annual interest rate, which is 5 percent.)
3. Add code to alculate the interest earned based on simple interest and compound interest. The formula for simple interest is $p = p_0 + (p_0 \times r \times t)$ and for compound interest it is $p = p_0 ( 1 + r ) ^t$. For both formulas, $p$ is the final value $p_0$ is the initial value, $r$ is the annual interest rate and $t$ is the number of years.
4. Add code to print the results like this

```None
$1,000.00 invested at 5.00 for 5.5 years will yield:
     $1,275.00 with simple interest.
     $1,307.80 with compound interest, a difference of $32.80.
```

## 7. Functions, main()

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E7.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. In this exercise we will create a `main()` function using the code from `E6.py` above.
3. Create a function definition for a `main()` function. As below. 

```python
# 
def main() -> None:
   p_0 = float(input("Enter the initial value of the investment: "))
   print(p_0)
```

4. Run your program. Nothing will happen! A `def` statement defines a function, that is it creates a memory location that it names `main` and puts the indented statements that follow the `def` into that location, but it does not execute the code!
5. Add the last line shown here.
```python
#
def main() -> None:
   p_0 = float(input("Enter the initial value of the investment: "))
   print(p_0)

main()
```

6. Run the program now.
7. Add the code from `E6.py` so that this program behaves exactly as that one does, but using a main function.
8. From now on all programs will be structured like this: 

```Python
# 
# Header comment that includes your name, date, what the program is
# 

# import any modules that you need ... 
import math
import random 

# Any constants that you need ... 

TIP_RATE = 0.10
GST = 0.05 
ASSIGNMENT_WEIGHT = 10

# function definitions ... 

def foo( x:float, n:int)->bool: 
   """ foo takes two parameters and if they are both positive it returns 
   True, else it returns False """
   if x > 0 and n > 0: 
      return True
   else 
      return False

# A main function. Main usually has no parameters and returns None. 

def main() -> None: 
   """ pass is a placeholder operation that does nothing. It is just there until the readl 
   code gets added"""
   pass 

# invoke main() 

main()
```

## 8. Functions

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E8.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. In this exercise we will create a complete program to ask the user for the radius and height of a cylinder and print the volume of that cylinder.
3. To start, create a `main()` function that prompts the user for the values above (radius and height).
3. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$. The first part, $\pi r^2$ is of course the area of a circle. Create a function called ``area_circle()`` that takes the radius of a circle and returns the area. You can access the value of pi using the math module, ``math.pi``.
4. Test your area function by putting some `print()` statements in your main to print some values of `area_circle()`. A good one is a radius of 1, because the area should be equal to pi.
5. Once you are convinced your area function is working, delete or comment out the test code.
6. Create a function `volume_cylinder()` that calculates the volume of the cylinder and uses the `area_circle()` function you just created. 
7. Test your program. You should get:

| radius  | height  | volume |
----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | 10| 31.4159 |
| 2 | 10| 125.6637 | 
| 0.5 |1.65 | 1.2959 |

## 9. Decisions

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E9.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. In this program we will enter a percentage (grade in a course) and convert it to the following letter grades:

| Percentage | Grade |
|------------|-------|
| 0-49       | Unsatisfactory |
| 50-69      | Satisfactory |
| 70-89       | Good |
| 90-100  | Excellent |

3. Write a main function that prompts to the user to enter the percentage score to 2 decimal places. 
4. Convert that percentage score to an integer using the `math.ceil()` function. This rounds UP. 
5. Write a function, `letter_grade()` that takes the integer percentage as a parameter and returns the appropriate string. This function should use a ``if-elif` structure.  
6. Call `letter_grade()` and print the result. Test your program. 

## 10. Compound Boolean Expressions

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E10.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. In this program we will implement the a grocery store discount calculator. In this scenario, a customer will get a 20% discount if they spend more than $100 on the first Tuesday of the month.
3. The basic flow of the program is:
   1. Enter the a amount of the purchase. 
   2. Enter a True/False to indicate if it is the first Tuesday of the month.
   3. If the amount >= 100 and it is the first Tuesday then apply a 20% discount to the total and print a message. Otherwise print a sorry you do not qualify message. 
   4. Calculate the total including the GST and print that out. 
4. Since we are simulating this you can use the following function to determine if it is the first Tuesday. So you only need to input the amount. 

```Python
import random 

PROBABILITY_TUESDAY = 0.4 # the probability that it is the first Tuesday of the month

def first_tuesday()-> bool:
    n = random.random() # get a number between 0 and 1
    return n < PROBABILITY_TUESDAY

```

5. Test your code with appropriate test values. Try it with 0, below the cut off, at the cut off, above the cut off. The `first_tuesday()` function will randomly give you true or false so test enough times to try all possibilities.

## 11. More decisions

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E11.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Tickets for a show at the Bella Concert Hall are priced as follows:  

| Section | Code | Price |
|---------|------|-------|
| Orchestra | O    | 100  |
| Parterre  | P   | 80 |
| Balcony   | B | 70 |
| Box       | X | 200 |

For the Parterre and Balcony sections seniors (over 65 years old) get 40% off and children 12 and under get 25% off.

3. Complete and test the following function that calculates the price of a ticket. 

```Python
def ticket_cost(age:int, section:str) -> float:
```

## 12. Even More Decisions

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E12.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. In this exercise you will create a function to determine if it good to go outside given some weather information.
3. Prompt the user to enter the temperature, the wind speed, and whether or not there is precipitation.
4. The rules go like this:
   1. If the wind is above 80 kph, do not go out.
   2. If it is less than -25 or more than 37, do not go out.
   3. If there is precipitation and wind above 50 kph, don't do out. 
   4. If there is precipitation and wind above 30 kph and the temperature is less than 0, do not go out.
5. Complete this function which returns True if you should go out, False otherwise.
6. Test your program.

```Python
def outside(temp:int, wind:int, precip:bool) -> bool:
```

## 13. For Loops

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E13.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. In this exercise you will create a function that returns a string consisting of selected letters of the alphabet.
3. Your function should take two parameters: the start letter and the end letter and return a string. 

---
Python provides some functions for working with characters, converting them to integers and back to characters.

```Python

a_letter = "a"
a_int = ord(a_letter)
print(a_int)

z_int = chr(122)
print(z_int)
```

Run the code above. You will see that the code for a lower case 'a' is 97 and that the code for a lower case 'z' is 122. 

---

4. Write code to return a string of lower case letters, in order, between the two parameters. For example, if the parameters are 10 and 15 
we want to return the 10th to 15th letter of the alphabet, or 'jklmno'. 
5. Test your code. For values outside the range use the endpoints. That is if the start letter is 0 or less, use 1. If the end letter is more than 26, use 26.

## 14. While Loops

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E14.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Write a progam that asks the user for a list of words, repeating until a blank word is entered.
3. From the words entered, create a single string that has all of the words separated by commas. Print out that string.

## 15. More While Loops and a List

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E15.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Convert this for loop to a functionally equivalent while loop: 
```Python
a = []
for q in range(2,10,2):
   a.append( q ** 3)
```

## 16. Strings 

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E16.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Write a main() function that prompts the user to enter a sentence. 
3. Write a function that converts a sentence to sarcastic text. The first letter should be capitalized and the following letters should alternate lower and upper case.

## 17. Files

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E17.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Write a program that prompts for a text file name and a ``word``. 
3. The program will read the text file, line by line and print the lines that contain ``word``. 
4. Add code to make the searching case insensitive. 

## 18. File and Lists

1. In VS-Code, open a new Python file. Call it `E18.py`. and add the required header comment block.
2. Write a program that prompts for a text file name, reads the contents of the file and stores each line as list of words. Words are strings of characters separated by whitespace. 
3. Add code to prompt for a word to find in the file and responds with how many occurences there are of that word. This should be done not case sensitive.
